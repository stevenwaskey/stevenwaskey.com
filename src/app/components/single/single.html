								&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a lucky guy married to an amazing woman.  I'm 35 years old, but I prefer to only act my age when I really have to.  I'm motivated by people.  I love good energy & I love growth.  I'm fueled by the excitement of challenge.  I'm intrigued by the thought behind design; whether it's the designer, or the designer's audience I'm into at the moment.  I love process refinement & implementation.  Maybe that's why I got into software engineering.  My current personal goal to obtain my private pilot license.  I've completed ground school, but still need to tackle flight hours.  (IFR, I'm coming for you.)  I enjoy trying to make web-apps more performant.  Why Hello, performance analytics.  Where have you been my whole life?  I have two dogs, Cooper & Bentley.  Cooper's rambunctious, always.  Bentley is probably sleeping on one of my pillows at this very moment.  I always choose to go the extra mile.  Details matter.  I enjoy competition.  If you're open to learn from every loss, then in the end, you'll always win.  I shoot archery, but don't get to near as much these days as I used to. (That'll change again someday.)  Nothing can replace being outside in Florida on a sunny day.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;My first web project was in 1996.  My father owned an internet company (called Sunny, FL Internet) when I was younger.  I thought I was hot-shit rolling up to a T1 at work.  I spent a few years doing graphics, enjoyed it, but ultimately didn't feel fulfilled from it.  I needed to keep on the journey.  I recognized that to increase my value as a web guy, I needed to be better at the dev side.  So I started programming a little.  I loved it.  It was very black & white, true or false, on or off ... There were no blurred lines.  You either hit the mark, or you didn't.  After a 5 or 6 years of bustin' my ass, I got burnt out.  I spent a few years working in a power-sports shop.  What a blast for a kid who loved riding dirt.  This was where I started to learn people, and effective communications, really working as a team member - and I got to ride a lot of cool bikes.  
								<br /><br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;After about 5 years in power-sports world, I made my way back to tech.  Immediately feeling more empowered.  I jumped head first back into dev & engineering.  I was very fortunate to meet some sharp people & got to work on a few really fun projects.  Then, in 09, I started with with Mid Florida Community Services, Inc.  MFCS's mission was to help poverty-stricken families reach self-sufficiency.  Over the next 6 years, I developed all of our internal CRM applications.  It started as a very basic intake system to archive data & spit it back out on PDF.  It grew to house millions & millions of clients records over it's lifespan.  It helped keep electricity on for over 100,000 people in poverty.  It was something I was very passionate about - I love the idea of building technology that helps families find their footing for a better life.  It was an incredible experience designing apps for people (mostly, not all) that have no tech savvy.  I was terrible at UI/UX when I started, but it was profound what the challenges taught me.  There's a bunch more I could tell you, and I love talking about it .... so if you're bored, I can take care of that.  
								<br /><br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;I left MFCS in 2015 to start Atlas Results.  I simply wanted to write bad-ass web-apps to streamline business processes, and do it with elegant interfaces.  The challenge of trying to perfectly identify how to visually communicate your message or process is a journey without a destination.  There is no end.  You can only get better.
